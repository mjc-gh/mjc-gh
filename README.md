### 👋 Hey there!

**I'm Michael!!**

I am a computing scientist and engineering leader currently residing in New
York City. I enjoy writing software, crafting thoughtful user
experiences, and helping start-ups and companies leverage technology in
innovative ways.

Feel free to reach out about software engineering consulting opportunities. I
specialize in optimizing Rails/Ruby applications, mar-tech integrations, and
database and data pipeline performance problems.
