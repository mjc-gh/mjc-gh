### 👋 Hey there!

**I'm Michael!!**

I am a computing scientist and engineering leader currently residing in New
York City. I enjoy writing software, crafting thoughtful user
experiences, and helping start-ups and companies leverage technology in
innovative ways.

I'm currently looking for new engineering roles, especially anything
with **Rails** and/or **Rust**. Feel free to reach out about new opportunities!
